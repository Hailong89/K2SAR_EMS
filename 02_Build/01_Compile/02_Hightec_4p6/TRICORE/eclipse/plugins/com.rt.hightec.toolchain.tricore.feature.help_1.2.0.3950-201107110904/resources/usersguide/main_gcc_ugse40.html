<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >The Compiler is the central part of the  TriCore Development Platform. It converts the
input files written in a high level language such as C or C++ to machine specific
assembler instructions. Since these assembler instructions are not interchangeable
between different microprocessors a special compiler has to be created for every target
platform.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >The compiler is divided into two parts: the compiler frontend <a 
 id="dx63-115002"></a>and the compiler backend.<a 
 id="dx63-115003"></a> The
compiler frontend reads the input source code, analyzes the objects in it and writes their
relationship into a tree structure. This tree structure is transformed in a pseudo assembly
language called Register Transfer Language (RTL) <a 
 id="dx63-115004"></a><a 
 id="dx63-115005"></a>. This part of the compiler is not machine
specific but the same for all target platforms.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >After the creation of the RTL code the compiler backend generates code for the target platform.
In this state the tree structure generated by the compiler frontend is optimized. Redundant or
unused parts of the tree are removed. Parts of the tree may be moved to prevent statements to
be executed more than necessary. Additionally some user defined optimizations may be done in
this state of the compilation. After all of these tasks have been done the compiler outputs the
target specific assembler code.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >The TriCore compiler has an integrated preprocessor. <a 
 id="dx63-115006"></a>That means that the compiler accepts
raw source code as input which needs not to be preprocessed. By including the preprocessor
in the compiler the processes invoked by <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-gcc</span> are reduced. However the
preprocessor is included in the toolchain as stand-alone binary file. This binary is
invoked by <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-gcc</span> every time the preprocessed source code is to be output.

</div>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >The disadvantage of this feature is the loss of the clear mapping of the preprocessor options
specified for <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-gcc</span>. These options are accepted by both the preprocessor as
stand-alone binary and the compiler. If the preprocessor is invoked by <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-gcc</span>, these
options are passed to it. The built-in preprocessor of the compiler is disabled by the
option <a 
href="main_gcc_ugse41.html#lbl:cc1!-fpreprocessed"><span 
class="cmtt-12">-fpreprocessed</span></a>. Otherwise the preprocessor options are passed directly to the
compiler.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >The compiler is controlled by command line options. Most of these options add or remove
features to or from the optimization algorithms applied to the RTL code. These options
normally start with the character ’f’. Most of the options for adding a feature have a
negated form, too for removing the feature. The options for removing the feature
are starting with ’fno-’ (e.g. <span 
class="cmtt-12">-fasm</span> for enabling the <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">asm</span></span> statement and <span 
class="cmtt-12">-fno-asm</span>
for disabling the <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">asm</span></span> statement). These options to turn off a feature are often used
to remove one feature form a predefined set of features enabled by one option. For
example if all features enabled by optimization level 2 should be activated except
the inlineing of functions. The resulting options for the compiler would be <span 
class="cmtt-12">-O2</span> and
<span 
class="cmtt-12">fno-inline</span>.
</p><!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >Equivalent options are available for enabling and disabling warnings. The option enabling
warnings start with ’W’, the option to disable the respective warning starts with
’Wno-’.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >This manual describes only one of the options, either the positive or the negative
form.
