<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data ”in” those addresses is
treated the same for some particular purpose. For example there may be a ”read only”
section.
<a

<a 
 id="dx70-136004"></a>
</p><!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >The linker <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-ld</span> reads many object files (partial programs) and combines their contents
to form a runable program. When <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-as</span> emits an object file, the partial program is
assumed to start at address 0. <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-ld</span> assigns the final addresses for the partial program,
so that different partial programs do not overlap. This is actually an oversimplification, but it
suffices to explain how <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-as</span> uses sections.
</p><!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-ld</span> moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time addresses. These blocks
slide to their run-time addresses as rigid units; their length does not change and
neither does the order of bytes within them. Such a rigid unit is called a <span 
class="cmti-12">section</span>.
Assigning run-time addresses to sections is called <span 
class="cmsl-12">relocation</span>. It includes the task
of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to the proper run-time
addresses.
<a 
 id="dx70-136005"></a>
</p><!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >An object file written by <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-as</span> has at least three sections, any of which may be empty.
These are named <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">.</span><span 
class="ecss-1200">text</span></span>, <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">.</span><span 
class="ecss-1200">data</span></span> and <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">.</span><span 
class="ecss-1200">bss</span></span> sections. The <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">.</span><span 
class="ecss-1200">bss</span></span> section is used for local common
variable storage. You may allocate address space in the <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">.</span><span 
class="ecss-1200">bss</span></span> section, but you may not dictate
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
data to load into it before your program executes. When your program starts running, all the
contents of the <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">.</span><span 
class="ecss-1200">bss</span></span> section are zeroed bytes.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >To let tricore-ld know which data changes when the sections are relocated, and how to change
that data, <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-as</span> also writes to the object file details of the relocation needed. To
perform relocation <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-ld</span> must know, each time an address in the object file is
mentioned:
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >In this manual we use the notation <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003C;</span>secname<span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003E; &#x003C;</span>N<span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003E; </span>to mean ”offset <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003C;</span>N<span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003E; </span>into section
<span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003C;</span>secname<span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003E;</span>.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the <span 
class="cmsl-12">absolute </span>section. When
<span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-ld</span> mixes partial programs, addresses in the absolute section remain unchanged. For
example, address <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">0</span></span> is ”relocated” to run-time address 0 by <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-ld</span>. Although the linker
never arranges two partial programs’ data sections with overlapping addresses after linking, <span 
class="cmti-12">by</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">definition </span>their absolute sections must overlap. Address <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">absolute</span><span 
class="ecss-1200"> </span><span 
class="ecss-1200">239</span></span> in one art of a program is
always the same address when the program is running as address <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">absolute</span><span 
class="ecss-1200"> </span><span 
class="ecss-1200">239</span></span> in any other part
of the program.
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >The idea of sections is extended to the <span 
class="cmsl-12">undefined </span>section. Any address whose section is
unknown at assembly time is by definition rendered undefined <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003C;</span>U<span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003E;</span>˜where <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003C;</span>U<span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003E; </span>is filled
in later. Since numbers are always defined, the only way to generate an undefined
address is to mention an undefined symbol. A reference to a named common block
would be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly time so it has section
<span 
class="cmti-12">undefined</span>.
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >By analogy the word <span 
class="cmti-12">section </span>is used to describe groups of sections in the linked program.
<span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-ld</span> puts all partial programs’ text sections in contiguous addresses in the
linked program. It is customary to refer to the <span 
class="cmti-12">text section </span>of a program, meaning
all the addresses of all partial programs’ text sections. Likewise for data and <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="ecss-1200">.</span><span 
class="ecss-1200">bss</span></span>
sections.
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >Some sections are manipulated by <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-ld</span>; others are invented for use of <span 
class="cmtt-12">tricore-as</span> and
have no meaning except during assembly.
