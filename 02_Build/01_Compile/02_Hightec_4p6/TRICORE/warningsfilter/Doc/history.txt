    New workaround for the warning "deprecated".

    Module change:
    HTML_Categories.pm          -> 1.005
    WF_Gcc_Warning_Analyser.pm  -> 1.011

    Script change:
    WF_Configuration.pl         -> 1.006

3.013
    No new feature.
    Remove workarounds for Hightec compiler.

    Module change:
    WF_Gcc_Warning_Analyser.pm  -> 1.010

3.012
    New feature: 
    The filter generates now lists of warnings and directories,
    that allows the comparison of different tests.
    Small bugfixes in HTML file generation.

    Module change:
    HTML_Categories.pm          -> 1.004
    HTML_Dir.pm                 -> 1.003

3.010
    Correct small bug in the file's name generator
    All the forbidden Characters, like <>/\? are now replaced by a _ (underscore),
    because the operating System can't support this.
    Those errors can happen if the source file is not really a file,
    but a built-in function.

    Module change:
    WF_Statistics.pm            -> 1.004 

3.009
    All the separators in the path are converted to the Unix format 
    (/ instead of \)
    Change algorithmus in the Html librairy: the time and copyright informations
    are computed one time instead of one time per file.

    Module change:
    WF_Gcc_Warning_Analyser.pm  -> 1.008
    WF_Html_Lib.pm              -> 1.005

3.008
    Correct bug in the command line arguments:
    The argument was considered as undefined if it get the value 0
    This is fixed.
    Minor changes in the Txt2Html:
    argument --verbosity is now supported for this modul.
    The assembler warnings are now considered as Gcc warnings.
    The linker warnings are now condsidered as Gcc Warnings(experimental!)
    In the previous versions, they where considered as non Gcc Warnings.

    Module change:
    Txt2Html.pm                 -> 1.002
    WF_Config.pm                -> 1.004

    Script change:
    WF_Configuration.pl         -> 1.005
    WF_GetWarnings.pl           -> 1.006


3.007
    After trying the tool on other programs, with more warnings,
    I found a new one, that has an other syntax. the variable is given
    unquoted, so the tool didn't detect the variable, 
    and provide one category per warning.
    (don't be afraid: the warning is always detected!)
    The tool generates the list of files and the list of categories
    This functionality is provided, because we need the list of categories 
    to generate the links to the help. The generated files are available
    in the Lists directory.
    Now the categories of warnings can be linked to a document.
    For further details, look at the help
    I had informations about the license. So I change the module WF_Html_Lib.pm
    and the script WF_configuration.pl

    Module change:
    WF_Gcc_Warning_Analyser.pm  -> 1.006
    HTML_Categories.pm          -> 1.003
    HTML_Files.pm               -> 1.003
    WF_Config.pm                -> 1.003
    WF_Html_Lib.pm              -> 1.004

    New Modules 
    WF_Help_Linker.pm           -> 1.000
    WF_Lists.pm                 -> 1.000

    Script change:
    WF_Configuration.pl         -> 1.004
    WarnungsFilter              -> 3.007

    New Script:
    WF_Create_Lists             -> 1.000

3.006
    Since the update to Perl 5.8.0, all the librairies seem to work.
    So I reintoduce all the original functionalities that were already
    available under Unix, plus a few new ones.
    New Options:
    --history, to get the history (this file)
    --help, to get the help (this works now.)
    --version is now fully functional (it returns version for the modules

    New functionalities:
    - the files are now sorted by extensions
    - there are more HyperLinks, so the navigation is easier between 
      the directories for example.

    module change:
    HTML_Categories.pm          -> 1.002 
    HTML_Dir.pm                 -> 1.002 
    HTML_Files.pm               -> 1.002 
    HTML_Main.pm                -> 1.002 
    HTML_Main_Dir.pm            -> 1.002 
    WF_Config.pm                -> 1.002 
    WF_Gcc_Warning_Analyser.pm  -> 1.005

    WF_Statistics.pm            -> 1.003 

    script change:
    WF_Configuration.pl         -> 1.003 
    WF_Create_Html.pl           -> 1.003 
    WF_Sort_Warnings.pl         -> 1.002 

    new module:
    HTML_Ext.pm                 -> 1.000


3.005
    I found the Perl interpreter 5.8.0 on the network
    Now all the functionalities seem to be OK,
    the library FindBin works properly.
    The tool is now full compatible under Unix and Windows system.
    
    Module change:
    WF_Statistics.pm            -> 1.001
    WF_Path_Utils.pm            -> 1.001
    WF_Html_Lib.pm              -> 1.002
    WF_Gcc_Warning_Analyser.pm  -> 1.004

    WF_Txt2Html.pm              -> 1.001
    WF_HTML_Main_Dir.pm         -> 1.001
    WF_HTML_Dir.pm              -> 1.001
    WF_HTML_Files.pm            -> 1.001
    WF_HTML_Categories.pm       -> 1.001

    Script change:
    WF_Sort_Warnings.pl         -> 1.001
    WF_Configuration.pl         -> 1.002
    WF_Create_Html.pl           -> 1.002
    WF_Get_Warnings.pl          -> 1.002
    WF_Analyse_Warnings.pl      -> 1.002
    WarnungsFilter.pm           -> 1.005

3.004
    I introduced a patch, because the FindBin library does
    not work under Windows like under Unix.
    This can't be fixed, except if we upgrade to Perl 5.8
    So, this program is Windows specific.
    With this Patch, we have access to the help,
    if the launcher is correctly configured.

    module change:
    WF_Html_Lib.pm  -> 1.001

3.003
    In the warning analysis:
    A Warning is now allowed to have only a path, 
    without line or column number

    module change:
    WF_Gcc_Warning_Analyser.pm  -> 1.002


3.002
    remove the pauses in the HTML generator.

    module change:
    WF_Create_Html.pl           -> 1.001


3.001
    New option --ignore-case
    because the tool does not consider, that "DSW" is like "dsw"


    modules change:
    WF_configuration.pl         -> 1.001
    WF_Gcc_Warning_Analyser.pm  -> 1.001
    WF_Analyse_Warnings.pl      -> 1.001


3.000
    First release of the HTML version of WarnungsFilter
    This was adapted to the Windows Gcc compiler, 
    and to the version 5.003 of perl
    (The tool was previously designed for unix, and Perl 5.8)
