    <LI><P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">The same warning of the
    same file is more than one time displayed<BR>This happens for
    multiple included file (generally the H files)</SPAN>. That happens because the path of the
      incriminated file is not the same; for
    example, the Gcc work directory has change during the compilation
    (multiple recursive makefiles do this...) ,  so the relative path to
    a file has changed too. The tool can't detect this.
    If you think it can, just tell me how.</P>

    <LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium">There are a lot of grammatical /
    syntax error in the html documents<BR>The author has a very poor English language level. <BR>Send him corrections, and he will
    integrate it immediately in the current release.</P>

    <LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The 2 lines warnings are considers as 2 different
      warnings<BR>
    This is a problem, because the tool doesn't know, which warning is a 1 line warning,
    and which warning is a 2 lines (or more) warning.
    In the fact, the tool doesn't know any warning, it knows only the general warning's shema.
    The other possibility is to write in the tool a
    list of known 2 lines warnings. But this is dangerous.
    At the moment I prefer have a double warning instead of a big bug.</P>
